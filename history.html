        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Bank of Maldives (BML) was inaugurated on November 11, 1982. The Bank started commercial operations as a joint venture bank with 60% shares held by the Government of the Maldives (including its Agencies and Maldivian Companies) and 40% shares owned by International Finance Investment Company Limited (later IFIC Bank Limited), Dhaka, Bangladesh.
        </p>
        <p>
            BML was originally a joint venture between the Government of Maldives and IFIC Bank, Bangladesh. Following divestment by IFIC in 1992, the Government assumed a majority shareholding.
